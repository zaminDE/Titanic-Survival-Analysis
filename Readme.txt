🛳️ Titanic Survival Analysis
This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to explore the factors that affected passenger survival. It includes data cleaning, exploration, and visualization using Python libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib.

📁 Dataset
Source: Kaggle - Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

Format: CSV

Columns: PassengerId, Survived, Pclass, Name, Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, Ticket, Fare, Cabin, Embarked

🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
pandas – for data manipulation and analysis

matplotlib.pyplot – for basic visualizations



📊 Analysis Performed
Count of survivors vs non-survivors

Survival based on gender

Survival based on passenger class

Age-wise survival distribution

Fare and survival relationship

Cleaned missing values (especially in Age and Embarked columns)

📌 Key Insights
Females had higher survival rates than males

Passengers in higher classes had better chances of survival

Younger passengers had relatively better survival rates

Many missing values were found in Cabin column and were handled accordingly
